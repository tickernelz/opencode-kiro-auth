OpenCode plugin for AWS Kiro (CodeWhisperer) providing access to Claude and GPT-5.6
models with substantial trial quotas.

## Features

- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Supports AWS Builder ID (IDC), IAM Identity Center (custom
  Start URL), and Kiro Desktop (CLI-based) authentication.
- **Auto-Sync Kiro CLI**: Automatically imports and synchronizes active sessions from
  your local `kiro-cli` SQLite database.
- **Gradual Context Truncation**: Intelligently prevents error 400 by reducing context
  size dynamically during retries.
- **Intelligent Account Rotation**: Prioritizes multi-account usage based on lowest
  available quota.
- **High-Performance Storage**: Efficient account and usage management using native Bun
  SQLite.
- **Native Thinking Mode**: Streams Kiro's native reasoning to OpenCode's thinking
  block, with the reasoning flags declared on every thinking model, so it renders
  without any model configuration.
- **Kiro Effort Mapping**: Maps OpenCode thinking budgets to Kiro's native effort
  levels automatically, using each model's supported effort ladder.
- **Automated Recovery**: Exponential backoff for rate limits and automated token
  refresh.

## Installation

Add the plugin to your `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@zhafron/opencode-kiro-auth"]
}
```

That is the whole configuration. The plugin registers the `kiro` provider and
advertises every model Kiro exposes, including a `-thinking` companion for each
model that supports reasoning effort. Run `/models` to pick one.

Defining `provider.kiro.models` yourself replaces the plugin's registry entirely.
Only do that to rename or restrict models, and see the reasoning flags below if
any of them are `-thinking` models.

### Thinking Effort Configuration

Every effort-capable Claude model gets a `-thinking` companion, already carrying
the reasoning flags and an effort ladder as variants. Nothing to configure: pick a
`-thinking` model and cycle its variants to change reasoning depth.

Each `-thinking` entry declares two fields that OpenCode needs in order to render
reasoning:

```json
{
  "reasoning": true,
  "interleaved": { "field": "reasoning_content" }
}
```

Both are required. `reasoning` declares the capability, and `interleaved.field`
tells OpenCode that reasoning arrives in the non-standard `reasoning_content`
delta this plugin emits. If either is missing, OpenCode silently drops every
reasoning chunk and no thinking block appears.

If you override `provider.kiro.models` in your own config, you replace the
plugin's registry wholesale — copy both fields onto any `-thinking` model you
define, or reasoning will stop rendering.

Reasoning itself comes from the API: Kiro streams `reasoningContentEvent` on
thinking models, and the plugin forwards each one as a `reasoning_content` delta.
Nothing needs to be enabled for that. Models that instead inline reasoning as
`<thinking>` tags in their answer are still handled, via a fallback scraper.

Variants set `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`, which the plugin maps to Kiro's
native `effort` field. Bands are scaled to Kiro's real thinking ceiling
(1024-128000 on opus-4.8/opus-5), so every effort level including `xhigh` is
reachable from a budget alone:

| OpenCode budget | Kiro effort |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `<= 16384` | `low` |
| `<= 32768` | `medium` |
| `<= 65536` | `high` |
| `<= 98304` | `xhigh` |
| `> 98304` | `max` |

`xhigh` is only available on opus-4.7, opus-4.8, opus-5 and sonnet-5. Those models
get a five-variant ladder; the rest get four, and a budget in the `xhigh` band is
clamped to `max`.

Kiro's GPT-5.6 tiers are advertised directly under their base IDs as native reasoning
models:

| Model | Rate | Advertised context | Variants |
| ----- | ---- | ------------------ | -------- |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | `2.4x` | `272K` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | `1.0x` | `272K` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | `0.1x` | `272K` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |

GPT requests send effort as `reasoning.effort`, while Claude requests retain
`output_config.effort`. GPT does not accept the plugin's `max` level, so a global
`max` override is clamped to `xhigh`. Unlike Claude, GPT does not use a separate
`-thinking` companion or receive the legacy `<thinking_mode>` system-prompt tags.

Use `~/.config/opencode/kiro.json` for plugin-wide behavior such as auth sync,
account selection, retry limits, and `auto_effort_mapping`. A top-level `effort`
setting is a global override for all supported models, not a per-model setting.

## Setup

1. **Authentication via Kiro CLI (Recommended)**:
   - Perform login directly in your terminal using `kiro-cli login`.
   - The plugin automatically bootstraps a minimal `kiro` placeholder in
     OpenCode's `auth.json` when it detects the Kiro CLI database, then imports
     and synchronizes your active session on startup.
   - For AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO/IDC), the plugin imports both the token and device
     registration (OIDC client credentials) from the `kiro-cli` database.
2. **Direct Authentication**:
   - Run `opencode auth login`.
   - Select `Other`, type `kiro`, and press enter.
   - You'll be prompted for your **IAM Identity Center Start URL** and **IAM Identity
     Center region** (`sso_region`).
     - Leave it blank to sign in with **AWS Builder ID**.
     - Enter your company's Start URL (e.g. `https://your-company.awsapps.com/start`) to
       use **IAM Identity Center (SSO)**.
   - Note: the TUI `/connect` flow currently does **not** run plugin OAuth prompts
     (Start URL / region), so Identity Center logins may fall back to Builder ID unless
     you use `opencode auth login` (or preconfigure defaults in
     `~/.config/opencode/kiro.json`).
   - For **IAM Identity Center**, you may also need a **profile ARN** (`profileArn`).
     - If `kiro-cli` is installed and you've selected a profile once
       (`kiro-cli profile`), the plugin auto-detects it.
     - Otherwise, set `idc_profile_arn` in `~/.config/opencode/kiro.json`.
   - A browser window will open directly to AWS' verification URL (no local auth
     server). If it doesn't, copy/paste the URL and enter the code printed by OpenCode.
   - You can also pre-configure defaults in `~/.config/opencode/kiro.json` via
     `idc_start_url` and `idc_region`.
3. Configuration will be automatically managed at `~/.config/opencode/kiro.db`.

## Local plugin development

The simplest way to test local changes is to point OpenCode directly at your local repo
path in `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["/path/to/opencode-kiro-auth"]
}
```

Then build and restart OpenCode to pick up changes:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Status: 403 (AccessDeniedException / User is not authorized)

If you're using **IAM Identity Center** (a custom Start URL), the Q Developer /
CodeWhisperer APIs typically require a **profile ARN**.

This plugin reads the active profile ARN from your local `kiro-cli` database
(`state.key = api.codewhisperer.profile`) and sends it as `profileArn`.

Fix:

1. Run `kiro-cli profile` and select a profile (e.g. `QDevProfile-us-east-1`).
2. Retry `opencode auth login` (or restart OpenCode so it re-syncs).

### Error: No accounts

This happens when the plugin has no records in `~/.config/opencode/kiro.db`.

1. Ensure `kiro-cli login` succeeds.
2. Ensure `auto_sync_kiro_cli` is `true` in `~/.config/opencode/kiro.json`.
3. Retry the request; the plugin will attempt a Kiro CLI sync when it detects zero
   accounts.

### Note: `/connect` vs `opencode auth login`

If you need to enter provider-specific values for an OAuth login (like IAM Identity
Center Start URL / region), use `opencode auth login`. The current TUI `/connect` flow
may not display plugin OAuth prompts, so it can’t collect those inputs.

Note for IDC/SSO (ODIC): the plugin may temporarily create an account with a placeholder
email if it cannot fetch the real email during sync (e.g. offline).
It will replace it with the real email once usage/email lookup succeeds.

### Kiro CLI (Google/GitHub OAuth) users: plugin sync does not start

If you authenticated via `kiro-cli login` using Google or GitHub OAuth (not AWS Builder
ID or IAM Identity Center), OpenCode still needs a stored `kiro` auth entry before it
will call the plugin loader.

The plugin now creates that minimal placeholder automatically when it detects the local
Kiro CLI database. Restart OpenCode after `kiro-cli login`; the loader should then run
and sync your actual tokens into `kiro.db`. The placeholder values are not used for API
calls.

If bootstrap is skipped because `auth.json` is malformed, fix the JSON first. The plugin
will not overwrite malformed auth files because they may contain other provider
credentials.

**Important:** Ensure `auto_sync_kiro_cli` is `true` in `~/.config/opencode/kiro.json`
and that `kiro-cli login` succeeds.

The plugin supports extensive configuration options.
Edit `~/.config/opencode/kiro.json`:

```json
{
  "auto_sync_kiro_cli": true,
  "account_selection_strategy": "lowest-usage",
  "default_region": "us-east-1",
  "idc_start_url": "https://your-company.awsapps.com/start",
  "idc_region": "us-east-1",
  "rate_limit_retry_delay_ms": 5000,
  "rate_limit_max_retries": 3,
  "max_request_iterations": 20,
  "request_timeout_ms": 120000,
  "token_expiry_buffer_ms": 120000,
  "usage_sync_max_retries": 3,
  "usage_tracking_enabled": true,
  "auto_effort_mapping": true,
  "enable_log_api_request": false
}
```

### Configuration Options

- `auto_sync_kiro_cli`: Automatically sync sessions from Kiro CLI (default: `true`).
- `account_selection_strategy`: Account rotation strategy (`sticky`, `round-robin`,
  `lowest-usage`).
- `default_region`: AWS region (`us-east-1`, `us-west-2`).
- `idc_start_url`: Default IAM Identity Center Start URL (e.g.
  `https://your-company.awsapps.com/start`). Leave unset/blank to default to AWS Builder
  ID.
- `idc_region`: IAM Identity Center (SSO OIDC) region (`sso_region`). Defaults to
  `us-east-1`.
- `rate_limit_retry_delay_ms`: Delay between rate limit retries (1000-60000ms).
- `rate_limit_max_retries`: Maximum retry attempts for rate limits (0-10).
- `max_request_iterations`: Maximum loop iterations to prevent hangs (10-1000).
- `request_timeout_ms`: Request timeout in milliseconds (60000-600000ms).
- `token_expiry_buffer_ms`: Token refresh buffer time (30000-300000ms).
- `usage_sync_max_retries`: Retry attempts for usage sync (0-5).
- `auth_server_port_start`: Legacy/ignored (no local auth server).
- `auth_server_port_range`: Legacy/ignored (no local auth server).
- `usage_tracking_enabled`: Enable usage tracking and toast notifications.
- `auto_effort_mapping`: Automatically map OpenCode thinking budgets to Kiro effort
  levels for supported models (default: `true`).
- `enable_log_api_request`: Enable detailed API request logging. Request logs
  include the resolved `additionalModelRequestFields`, so this is how you confirm
  which effort level actually went out on the wire.
